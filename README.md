## Description
This repository contains codes written for the higher level programming languages at the ALX Software engineering course in conjunction with Holberton school of        computer science. In these projects, i have learnt the Python programming language, and i have used skills acquired to solving numerous tasks which have been duly      documented in this repo. simultaneously, I continued to expand my skills in C programming language and shell scripting, while advancing my knowledge of Data            Structures and Algorithm. This repo could serve as a source of learning material for aspiring Software Engineer.
 
## prerequisite
This repository is a continuation of [ALX-Low_level_programming](https://github.com/Loladecodes2/alx-low_level_programming.git) and serve to build and refine my skill as a software engineer.
